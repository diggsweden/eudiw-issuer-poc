## Code duplication maintenance notes

id-service-api should be public available dependency. As a work around the code is duplicated from a private repo.

mkdir ~/tmp
cd ~/tmp
git clone <git@gitlab.digg.se>:iam/apps/iam-id-proxy-service-api.git
cd id-service-api
cp -r  src/main/java/se/swedenconnect $LSP_PID_POC_HOME/auth/src/main/java/se/

And keep dependencies in build.gradle up to date.
